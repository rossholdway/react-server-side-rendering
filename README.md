# React Server Side Rendering

A repo with super basic React server side rendering / routing from scratch. No create-react-app cli here! Built to learn about the process. Uses React 16, React Router 4, Express 4 with Babel and Webpack for building.

`npm install` and build with `npm run build`. This creates a build directory containing the client and server code. To run cd into `./build` and then `node server`. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app. 

Webpack config is also super basic, containing only the minimum required for building. Create a production build with `npm run build:prod`.
